This repository contains the assignments and projects I developed during my studies in the AIM-5003 Numerical Methods course at the prestigious Katz School of Science and Health. Throughout this course, I had the opportunity to delve deep into various numerical methods and sharpen my skills in applying them to real-world problems. I am excited to share my work with you, and hope that you find it informative and insightful.
